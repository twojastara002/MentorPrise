When you get to this folder you need to clone and somehow hook the repo to your folders with git (i haven't done that so you need to find a way)
Then you can do:
  git branch -m gh-pages                                                  #set the page
  git remote add origin https://github.com/twojastara002/MentorPrise.git  #set the origin for commits
to set the right page to commit to and:
  git commit '<the name of the commit>' 
  git push
This will let you upload your work.
You might be required to add your credential when you get an error like 'git author unknown'.
I fixed with one command, try looking here. -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8283915/git-author-unknown
It will only work with an account that i managed to add because some people gave me their usernames to add them to the repository.
Message me your email or your username on github so i can add you.
