When you get to this folder you need to clone and somehow hook the repo to your folders with git (i haven't done that so you need to find a way) <br>
Then you can do: <br>
  git branch -m gh-pages                                                  #set the page <br>
  git remote add origin https://github.com/twojastara002/MentorPrise.git  #set the origin for commits <br>
to set the right page to commit to and: <br>
  git commit 'pick a name for your commit eg what you edited'  <br>
  git push <br>
This will let you upload your work. <br>
You might be required to add your credential when you get an error like 'git author unknown'. <br>
I fixed with one command, try looking here. -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8283915/git-author-unknown <br>
It will only work with an account that i managed to add because some people gave me their usernames to add them to the repository. <br>
Message me your email or your username on github so i can add you. <br>
